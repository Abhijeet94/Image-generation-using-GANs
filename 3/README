Image-to-Image Translation

- Run p1.py for part 1 and so on.
- p1 (image to sketch), p2 (image to sketch), p3 (sketch to image) use skip connections, p4 doesn't (p4 is for sketch to image)

- The input dataroot can be modified by changing the "image_location" variable in each of the files. This dataroot contains 4 folders - "trainA", "trainB", "testA", "testB" representing the training pair of images and the testing pair of images.
