Run the py as ipynb on colab

For part 1 ensure that the discriminator loss is commented out and the lambda parameter is ommitted

For part 2 set inverse_order = true

For part 3 set inverse_order = false

to generate the plots run: show_train_hist(train_hist, save = True)

The plots are generated in the cwd while the images are saved in GDrive in CUHK_results folder.

The code uses skip connections which is actually an ec. To not use skip connections uncomment the torch.cat in forward method of generator.
